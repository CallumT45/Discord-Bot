# MSc Discord Bot

MScBot is a bot powered by Python designed for use in my class discord server. MScBot has many features such as assignment tracking, polls, games, daily coding problems, meme fetching and more!

**Version 3.0**

Three new games added including Cards Against Humanity. Ability to create memes such as Change my Mind and Distracted Boyfriend. Leetcode problem is now called daily and Covid updates daily in the background. Added calculator and xkcd functions aswell. Hangman and TicTacToe were updated to reduce bot spam.

Known issue: No catch for large files in \$dankmeme

**Commands**

MScBot has a lot of features, split into 4 categories. Each commmand is called with a \$:

- **Funny** `$meme` `$joke` `$dankmeme` `$cmm` `$distracted` `$hotline` `$showerthought`

- **Games** `$tictactoe` `$hangman` `$quiz` `$blackjack` `$CaH` `$codenames`

- **Course** `$due` `$new` `$remove` `$problem` `$poll`

- **Misc** `$covid` `$insult` `$compliment` `$calc` `$xkcd`

There is also a feature to react to a message with ‚ùì, to create a google search link to that message.
