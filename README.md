# MSc Discord Bot

MScBot is a bot powered by Python designed for use in my class discord server. MScBot has many features such as assignment tracking, polls, games, daily coding problems, meme fetching and more!

__Version 3.0__

Three new games added including Cards Against Humanity. Ability to create memes such as Change my Mind and Distracted Boyfriend. Leetcode problem is now called daily and Covid updates daily in the background. Added calculator and xkcd functions aswell. Hangman and TicTacToe were updated to reduce bot spam.
